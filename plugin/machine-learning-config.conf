# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the machine-learning-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.machine-learning-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
#SecRule &TX:machine-learning-plugin_enabled "@eq 0" \

# Machine Learning plugin can be configured to run in 2 modes
# machine-learning-plugin_mode=1 means it will run on "false positive
# detection mode. This mode will aid in reduction of false positives
# machine-learning-plugin_mode=2 means it will run on "false positive
# training mode. 
# inbound_ml_status by default is set to 0. This will be updated by
# ml model and then it is used to check pass condition of ml model
# inbound_ml_pass_flag = 1 is initialized against which decision of 
# pass or deny is made
